# today

Easily view the work that you have done for the day, at a glance, using your `git commit` history. This is ideal for a daily standup where you want to see what you have done in the past.

This leverages your `git log`, so works best when paired with clear and concise commit messages. A great example of this is [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).

## Install

The easiest way to install is through the `go` command.

```bash
go install github.com/jdockerty/today@latest # or tag
```

Or by downloading a pre-compiled binary on the [releases](https://github.com/jdockerty/today/releases) page.

## Usage

Simply pass a local directory that you wish to view the work for, this also works over multiple directories, as work is not always confined to a single project.

```bash
today work/very-important-business-app

today work/api work/frontend work/new-important-serivce # You've been very busy

today --since 48h work/api # You missed standup yesterday
```

Modifying the time range is done using the `--since` flag, valid time units for this conform to [`time.ParseDuration`](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). The main use case for this is to extend or reduce the number of hours you wish to search across, but you may get incredibly precise if you so desire.
